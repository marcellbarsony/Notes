# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** extends a private network across a public network and enables users to safely exchange data across shared or public networks as if their computer were directly connected to the private network.<br>
**VPN** prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely.
The **VPN** technology is widely used in corporate environments.

A **VPN** is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated circuits or with tunneling protocols over existing networks.
