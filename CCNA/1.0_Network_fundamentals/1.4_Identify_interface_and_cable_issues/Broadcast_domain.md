# Broadcast domain

A **broadcast domain** is the domain in which a broadcast is forwarded.
A **broadcast domain** contains all devices that can reach each other at the data link layer (Layer 2) by using broadcast.

On a router, all ports are in the different broadcast domains and routers donâ€™t forward broadcasts from one broadcast domain to another.

There are 3 broadcast domains on the below example:

- All ports on a **hub** are in the **same broadcast domain**
- All ports on a **router** are in a **different broadcast domain**
