## Configure duplex and speed

By default, Cisco switches will auto-negotiate the speed and duplex settings.
When you connect a device (either a switch, router, or a workstation) to a port on a Cisco switch, the negotiation process will occur and the devices will agree on the transmission parameters.
Most of the todayâ€™s network adapters support this function.
