## Full Duplex & Half Duplex

In telecommunication, a **duplex communication system** is a point-to-point system of two devices that can communicate with each other in both direction.
These two types of duplex communication systems exist in Ethernet environments:

- **half-duplex** – a port can send data only when it is not receiving data.
  In other words, it cannot send and receive data at the same time.
  Network hubs run in half-duplex mode in order to prevent collisions.
  Since hubs are rare in modern LANs, the half-duplex system is not widely used in Ethernet networks anymore.

- **full-duplex** – all nodes can send and receive on their port at the same time.
  There are no collisions in full-duplex mode, but the host NIC and the switch port must support the full-duplex mode.
  Full-duplex Ethernet uses two pairs of wires at the same time instead of a single wire pair like half-duplex.
