## Collision domain

A **collision domain** is the part of the network where packet collisions can occur.
A collision occurs when two devices send a packet at the same time on the shared network segment.
When packets collide, both devices mst send the packets again.

Collisions are often in a **hub** environment, because each port is in the same collision domain.<br>
On a **bridge**, **switch** or a **router** is in a separate collision domain.

On the below example there are 6 collision domains.
