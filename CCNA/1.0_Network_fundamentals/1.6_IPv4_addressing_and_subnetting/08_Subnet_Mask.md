## Subnet Mask

An IP address is divided into two parts:

- Network
- Host

The **Subnet mask** determines which part is the network and which part is the host part.<br>
The **Subnet mask** also determines if the device is remote or local.

## Slash notation

**Subnet mask** cam be also written in **slash notation**.<br>
To determine the slash notation of the subnet mask, convert the dotted decimal format into binary, count the series of 1s, and add a slash on the start.

For example, we have the dotted decimal **subnet mask** of **255.0.0.0**.<br>
In binary, it is **11111111.00000000.00000000.0000000**.<br>
The number of succeeding 1s are 8, therefore the slash notation of **255.0.0.0** is **/8**.
