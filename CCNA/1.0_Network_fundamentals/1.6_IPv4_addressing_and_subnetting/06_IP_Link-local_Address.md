## Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-local Addresses

**Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)** is a feature in operating systems that enables computers to automatically self-configure an IP address and subnet mask when their DHCP server isnâ€™t reachable.

The IP address range for APIPA is **169.254.0.1**-**169.254.255.254**, with the subnet mask of **255.255.0.0**.
