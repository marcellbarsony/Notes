## Switches (L2 & L3)

A switch is a **Layer 2** device.

The switch has "intelligence":  it reads the frames received on Ethernet. 

The switch use a MAC address table to only forward the frames out of the correct ports. 

The switch is used for sending traffic in a LAN.

## Bridge

A Bridge is an intermediate device between a switch and a hub.

### Bridge vs Switch

* A bridge learns MAC addresses in software.
* The switch learns MAC addresses much more quickly by using hardware **ASIC**s (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)
