# HUB (Repeater)

A hub serves as a central point to which all of the hosts in a network connect to.

A hub is a **Layer 1** device: it has no concept of Ethernet frames or addressing.
It simply receives a signal from one port and sends it out to all other ports.

## Repeater

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it.
Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction.

The repeater doesn't understand the actual signal but amplifies it from one port to another, just like a hub.

A hub essentially is a multi-port repeater.

## Attenuation

Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal. The longer the distance the less strong a signal.
