## Servers

In computing, a server is a computer program or a devices that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

This architecture is called the Server-Client model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.

A server needs to have the capacity (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.) to service the request(s).

A server can provide multiple services for their clients.

## Client

A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

## Protocol

Protocol is a set of rules used for communication between devices. Protocols just like languages.

## Port

Ports are like radio frequencies or TV channels.
