# Network

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair of fibre-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.

In the example below, the two computers are directly connected using a cable.

## Node

In networking, a node is a computing device (laptop, server, phone, etc.) or a specialized device (router, switch, hub, firewall, etc.).

## Modulation

Modulation is a process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.

Most radio systems in the 20<sup>th</sup> century used frequency modulation **(FM)** or amplitude modulation **(AM)** for radio broadcast.
