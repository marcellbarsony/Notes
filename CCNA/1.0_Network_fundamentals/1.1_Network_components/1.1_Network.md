## Network

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair of fibre-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.


## Modulation

Modulation is a process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation **(FM)** or amplitude modulation **(AM)** for radio broadcast.
