## Routers

A **router** (**Layer 3**) has routing functionality, as it routes from one IP network to another.

**Routers** divide broadcast domains and have traffic filtering capabilities,

When a packet comes to a router port, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine out which port the packet will be sent.
