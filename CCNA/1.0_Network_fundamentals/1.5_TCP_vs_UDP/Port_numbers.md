## Port numbers

In computer networking, a **port** is a software-based virtual communication endpoint. Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific process or service.

Port numbers are assigned in various ways, based on three ranges:

- System Ports (0-1023)
- User Ports (1024-49151)
- Dynamic and/or Private Ports (49152-65535)

The [IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses.

Service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between different
services that run over transport protocols such as TCP, UDP, DCCP, and
SCTP.
