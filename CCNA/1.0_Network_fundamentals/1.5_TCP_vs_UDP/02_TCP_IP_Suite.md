## TCP/IP Suite of protocols

The **TCP/IP suite** is a set of protocols used on a computer networks today.<br>
It provides end-to-end connectivity by specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received on a **TCP/IP** network.
This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers.

Some of the protocols included in the **TCP/IP suite**

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** – used to associate an IP address with a MAC address.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – used to deliver packets from the source host to the destination host based on the IP addresses.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** – used to detects and reports network error conditions. Used in ping.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – a connection-oriented protocol that enables reliable data transfer between two computers.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – a connectionless protocol for data transfer. Since a session is not created before the data transfer, there is no guarantee of data delivery.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** – used for file transfers from one host to another.
- **Telnet (Telecommunications Network)** – used to connect and issue commands on a remote computer.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – used for host names to the IP address resolution.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** – used to transfer files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.

| Layer       | Protocol                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Application | HTTP, NFS, DNS, FTP, SNMP, telnet       |
| Transport   | TCP, UDP                                |
| Internet    | Ipv4, IPv6, ARP, ICMP                   |
| Link        | Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Token Ring, FDDI |
