## TCP vs UDP

### Session multiplexing

**TCP** and **UDP** allow for **session multiplexing**.

**Session multiplexing** is when a single host with a single IP address is able to communicate with multiple servers (or multiple devices) and have mutiple session iccur simultaneously.

A session is created when a source host needs to send data or information to a destination host.
Replies are often received but not mandatory.
The session is created and controlled within the network application, which contains the functionality of OSI layers 5 through 7.
