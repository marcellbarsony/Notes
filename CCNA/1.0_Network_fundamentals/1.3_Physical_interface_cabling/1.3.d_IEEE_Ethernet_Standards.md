# IEEE Standards

Ethernet is defined in a number of IEEE 802.3 standards.
These standards define the physical and data-link layer specifications for Ethernet.

The most important 802.3 standards are:

- **10Base-T (IEEE 802.3)** – 10 Mbps with category 3 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) wiring, up to 100 meters long.
- **100Base-TX (IEEE 802.3u)** – known as Fast Ethernet, uses category 5, 5E, or 6 UTP wiring, up to 100 meters long.
- **100Base-FX (IEEE 802.3u)** – a version of Fast Ethernet that uses multi-mode optical fiber. Up to 412 meters long.
- **1000Base-CX (IEEE 802.3z)** – uses copper twisted-pair cabling. Up to 25 meters long.
- **1000Base-T (IEEE 802.3ab)** – Gigabit Ethernet that uses Category 5 UTP wiring. Up to 100 meters long.
- **1000Base-SX (IEEE 802.3z)** – 1 Gigabit Ethernet running over multimode fiber-optic cable.
- **1000Base-LX (IEEE 802.3z)** – 1 Gigabit Ethernet running over single-mode fiber.
- **10GBase-T (802.3.an)** – 10 Gbps connections over category 5e, 6, and 7 UTP cables.

1. The first number in the name of the standard represents the speed of the network in megabits per second.<br>
2. The word Base refers to baseband, meaning that the signals are transmitted without modulation.<br>
3. The last part of the standard name refers to the cabling used to carry signals:

- **1000Base-T** means that the speed of the network is up to 1000 Mbps.
- **Baseband** signaling is used.
- **Twisted-pair** cabling is used (**T** stands for twisted-pair).
