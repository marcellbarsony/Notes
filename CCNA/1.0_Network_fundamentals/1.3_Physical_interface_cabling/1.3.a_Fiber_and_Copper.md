## Ethernet cabling

There are three cable types commonly used for Ethernet cabling:
- Coaxial
- Twisted pair
- Fiber-optic cabling

In today's LANs, twisted pair cabling is the most popular, but the fiber-optic technology usage is increasing within high performance networks.
Coaxial cabling generally used for cable internet access.

## Coaxial cabling

A **coaxial cable** has an inner conductor that runs down the middle of the cable.
The conductor is surrounded by a layer of insulation which is surrounded by another conducting shield, which makes tha cable resistant to outside interference.


**Coaxial cabling** comes in two types:
- Thinnet
- Thicknet

Both types have maxumum transmission speed of 10 Mbps.

## Twisted pair cabling

A **twisted pair** cable has four pair of wires.
These wires twisted around each other to reduce crosstalk and outside interference.

**Twisted pair** cables come in two versions:
- UTP – Unshielded Twisted-Pair
- STP – Shielded Twisted-Pair

The difference is that an STP cable has an additional layer of insulation that protects data from outside interference.

### RJ-45

The **RJ-45** plug is a standardized connector used for Ethernet networking.

The 8 position contact **(8P8C)** is a modular connector commonly used to terminate twisted pair and multi-conductor flat cable.

An **8P8C** modular connection consists of a male plug and a female jack, each with 8 equally-spaced contacts.

## Fiber-optic cabling

This cabling uses optical fibers to transmit data in the form of light signals.
The cables have strands of glass surrounded by a cladding material.

### Fiber-optic cable types

- **Single-mode fiber (SMF)** – uses only a single ray of light to carry data. Used for larger distances.
- **Multi-mode fiber (MMF)** – uses multiple rays of light to carry data. Less expensive than SMF.

### Fiber-optic cable connectors

- **ST** – Straight-tip connector
- **SC** – Subscriber connector
- **FC** – Fiber Channel
- **LC** – Lucent Connector
