# Concepts of PoE

**Power over Ethernet** is a technology that transmits both electrical power and network data over an ethernet cable.

- **Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)** - The PoE device like LAN switches that are supplying power is called Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE).

- **Powered Device (PD)** – The device like IP phones or access points that are being powered is called Powered Device (PD).

The power that is supplying is in Direct Current (DC) form.

## Autonegotiation

**Autonegotiation** is a IEEE standard that ensures the power level is sufficient enough and will not destroy the PD.

**Autonegotiation** initiates a handshake procedure that establishes how much power the PD requires.
The handshake needs to be established while PD is off, as PD needs power to boot and initialize.

During **autonegotiation**, the PD is signalling the PSE of how much wattage of power it requires.

## PoE Standards

- **PoE** – IEEE 802.3af standard that supplies up to 15 watts of DC power from PSE and 12.95 watts from PD due to losses on an ethernet cable.
  It uses two pairs of wires like CAT3 or CAT5 cables as a medium.

- **PoE+** – IEEE 802.3at standard that supplies power up to 30 watts of DC power from PSE and 25.5 watts from PD due to losses on an ethernet cable.
  It is also using two pairs of wires like CAT5 or higher as a medium.

- **UPoE (Universal PoE)** – IEEE 802.3bt standard that supplies power up to 60 watts of DC power from PSE and 51 watts from PD due to losses on an ethernet cable.
  It uses four pairs of wire as a medium.

- **UPoE+ (Universal PoE +)** – IEEE 802.3bt standard that supplies power up to 100 watts of DC power from PSE and 71.3 watts from PD due to losses on an ethernet cable.
  It is also using four pairs of ethernet cabling as a medium.

## PoE Implementation

1. **Endspan** – is a PoE switch and sometimes called "endpoint".
   The ethernet port of the switch can supply both power and data to devices that support PoE.

2. **Midspan** – if there is an existing non-PoE switch on the network, and needs to power up a devices that requires PoE, then a PoE device needs to be put in between the non-PoE switch and a PD.
   A commonly known midspan is a PoE injector.
