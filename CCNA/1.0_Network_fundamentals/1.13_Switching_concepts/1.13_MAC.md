## MAC

A **Media Access Control (MAC)** address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller **(NIC)** for use as a network address in communication within a network segment.

**MAC addresses** are primarily assigned by device manufacturers and are therefore often referred as the burned-in address or an Ethernet hardware address, and **physical address**. Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory (ROM), or by a firmware mechanism.

**MAC addresses** are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator:<br>
```sh
ether 8c:8c:aa:00:6a:2c
```

This use is common in most **IEEE 802** networking technologies (including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth).
