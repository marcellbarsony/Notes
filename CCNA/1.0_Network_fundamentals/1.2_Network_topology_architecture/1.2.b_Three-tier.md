# Three-Tier Network Architecture

**Campus Network** – A computer network that is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network.)
It usually connects buildings withing a limited geographical area.

**Core Layer** – It server as the backbone of the network and interconnects distribution switches.
These devices should be high-speed and able to forward packets as quickly as possible.

**Distribution Layer** – Distribution switches aggregate traffic from the access layer switches before it is transmitted to the core layer.
Routing, filtering, and QoS features are usually managed here.

**Access Layer** – Access switches connect end devices (e.g., computer, phone, printer, camera, etc.) to the network.

## Collapsed Core Architecture

### Advantages

- **Lower costs** – The organization can save money by reducing the number of hardware.

- **Simplified network** – Configuring and managing the devices are less complex, with only 2 layers requiring communication.

### Limitations

- **Less scalable** – Fewer devices mean scalability is limited, especially with rapidly growing number of end-users.
  By **CISCO**'s definition, a small network provides services for up to 200 devices, while a medium-size network provides 200 to 1000 devices.

- **Resiliency** – In a Collapsed Core design, the collapsed core switches are also performing other functions of the distribution switch, which results in a higher utilization.
  This can lea to degraded services.

- **Redundancy** – With fewer devices needed to run the network, there is a lower redundancy to cover the failures of individual components.

## Collapsed Core & 3-tier Architecture Comparison

| Collapsed Core                           | 3-Tier                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 layers                                 | 3 layers                                           |
| Core and Distribution functions combined | Core and Distribution are separated functions      |
| Small and medium-sized networks          | Large campus networks                              |
| Less cost                                | Expensive                                          |
| Lacks redundancy                         | More fault tolerance                               |
| Less resilient                           | More resilient                                     |
| Simplified design                        | Complex design, requires advanced technical skills |
