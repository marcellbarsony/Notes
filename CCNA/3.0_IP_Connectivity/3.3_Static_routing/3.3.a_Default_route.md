# Default Route

**Default Route** establishes a forwarding rule for packets when no specific address of a next-hop host is available from the routing table or other routing mechanisms.<br>

The **Default Route** is generally the address of another router, which treats the packet the same way:

- If a route matches, the packet is forwarded accordingly.
- Otherwise the packet is forwarded to the default route of that router.

The device to which the default route points is often called the **Default Gateway**, and it often carries out other functions such as _packet filtering_, _firewalling_, or _proxy server operations_.

The **Default Route** in **IPv4** is designated as the zero address: **0.0.0.0/0** in CIDR.<br>
The **Default Route** in **IPv6** is specified by **::/0**.<br>
The subnet mask is specified as **/0**, which effectively specifies all networks and is the shortest match possible.
A route lookup that does not match any other rule falls back to this route.

## Route Evaluation Process

The **Route Evaluation Process** in each router uses the longest prefix match method to obtain the most specific route:
The network with the longest subnet mask or network prefix that matches the destination IP address is the next-hop network gateway.

The process repeats until a packet is delivered to the destination host, or earlier along the route, when a router has no default route available and cannot route the packet otherwise.
In the latter case, the packet is dropped and an **ICMP Destination Unreachable** message may be returned.
