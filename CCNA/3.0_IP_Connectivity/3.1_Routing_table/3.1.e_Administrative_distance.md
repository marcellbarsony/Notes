# Routing protocol code & Administrative Distance

**Administrative Distance (AD)** or route preference is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes.<br>

**Administrative Distance** is the first criterion that a router uses to determine which routing protocol to use if two protocols provide route information for the same destination.
**Administrative Distance** is a measure of the trustworthiness of the source of the routing information.
**Administrative Distance** has only local significance, and is not advertised in routing updates.

## Default Administrative Distances

Common routing protocol codes and their administrative distances used on Cisco Routers.

| Code | Route Type              | Administrative Distance |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| C    | Connected               | 0                       |
| S    | Static                  | 1                       |
| D    | EIGRP summary route     | 5                       |
| -    | External BGP            | 20                      |
| -    | Internal EIGRP          | 90                      |
| I    | IGRP                    | 100                     |
| O    | OSPF                    | 110                     |
| -    | IS-IS                   | 115                     |
| R    | RIP                     | 120                     |
| -    | EGP                     | 140                     |
| -    | On-Demand Routing (ODR) | 160                     |
| EX   | External EIGRP          | 170                     |
| B    | Internal BGP            | 200                     |
| -    | DHCP default gateway    | 254                     |
| -    | Unreachable             | 255                     |

## Configuration

The **Administrative Distance** may be modified by the network administrator to change the desired ranking of router protocols.
This may be necessary in cases where routing redistribution has to be used, otherwise, routing loops would occur.

```
R1<nowiki>></nowiki> '''enable'''
R1# '''configure terminal'''
R1(config)# '''router rip'''
R1(config-router)# '''distance 89'''
```

Manually configuring the **Administrative Distance** is also required when configuring a **floating static route**.
Floating static routes are used to provide an alternate path when a primary link fails.
In order for static routes to be configured as a backup, the static route's **Administrative Distance** would need to be adjusted.
Otherwise, it will take precedence over all routing protocols and routes issued from a routing protocol will not be inserted into the routing table.

The example shows how to configure the **Administrative Distance** to 254 to specify that it should only be used as a last resort.

```
R1(config)# ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 backupLink 1 254
```

The configuration can be verified with the `show ip route` command.
