## Metrics

**Router metrics** are metrics used by a router to make routing decision among multiple feasible routes to a destination.<br>

A **metric** can include:

- Measuring link utilization (using SNMP)
- Hop count
- Speed of the path
- Packet loss (router congestion/conditions)
- Network delay
- Path reliability
- Path bandwidth
- Path length
- Throughput [SNMP - query routers]
- Load
- Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
- Administrator configured value

A metric can be considered as:

- **Additive** - the total cost of a path is the sum of the costs of individual links along the path,
- **Concave** - the total cost of a path is the minimum of the costs of individual links along the path,
- **Multiplicative** - the total cost of a path is the product of the costs of individual links along the path.

## Routing Protocols and their Metrics

| Routing Protocol | Metric           |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| RIP              | Hop count        |
| EIGRP            | Bandwidth, Delay |
| OSPF             | Bandwidth, Cost  |
