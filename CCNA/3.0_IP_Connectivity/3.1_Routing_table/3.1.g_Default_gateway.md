# Default Gateway (Gateway of last resort)

A **Default Gateway** (Gateway of last resort) is the node in the computer network that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.

[[Wikipedia - Default Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_gateway)]

## Role

A gateway is an access point to another network, often involving not only a change of addressing, but also a different networking technology.
More narrowly defined, a router merely forwards packets between networks with different network prefixes.

The networking software stack of each computer contains a routing table that specifies which interface is used for transmission and which router on the network is responsible for forwarding to a specific set of addresses.
If none of these forwarding rules is appropriate for a given destination address, the default gateway is chosen as the router of last resort.

Enterprise network systems may require many internal network segments:<br>
A device wishing to communicate with a host on the public Internet, forwards the packet to the default gateway for its network segment.
This router also has a default route configured to a device on an adjacent network, one hop closer to the public network.

## Utilities

Various utility software can show the default gateway:

- **Windows**: ipconfig
- **Unix**: ifconfig or iproute2
