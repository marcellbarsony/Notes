# Network Mask

The **Network Mask** (Subnet Mask) is used to match a destination IP address to the network ID.

Each routing entry in the routing table consists of the destination address, subnet mask and the "route to" field.
When a message needs to be routed to an IP address, the following steps are followed:

1. The destination IP address is masked with the subnet mask and then compared with the destination field for all entries in the routing table.
2. This comparison may yield a match with more than one entry - the entry with the longest subnet mask wil be selected.
3. Once an entry has been selected, the "route to" field is consulted and the action taken depends on the contents of this field:

- If the "route to" field contains SELF the packet is meant for this node.
  The IP packet is passed to the OS for application processing
- If the "route to" field contains a LAN interface id, the packet is destined for a LAN that is directly connected to the router/host.
  In this case, the packet is routed directly on the LAN.
- If the "route to" field contains an IP address, the packet is forwarded to the IP address specified.
  Further routing of the packet will be carried out by the specified IP address.
