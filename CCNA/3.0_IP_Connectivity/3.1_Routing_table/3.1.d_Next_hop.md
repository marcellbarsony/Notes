# Next hop

**Next hop** is a routing term that refers to the next closest router a packet can go through.<br>
The **Next hop** is among the series of routers that are connected together in a network and is the next possible destination for a data packet.

**Next hop** is an IP address entry in a router's routing table, which specifies the next closest/most optimal router on its routing path.

[[Cisco - specify a Next Hop IP Address for Static Routes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/dial-access/floating-static-route/118263-technote-nexthop-00.html)]

Three types of routing table entries for the next hop of the router:

- **Next-hop route** – We specify only the IP address of the next-hop router in the routing table.

- **Directly connected static route** – We only specify the router exit interface connected to the next-hop router.

- **Fully specified static route** – We specify both the next-hop IP address and exit interface.
