# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.
**BGP** is classified as a [path-vector routing protocol](), and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.
**BGP** routing information includes the complete route to each destination.
