# Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)

**Exterior Gateway Protocol** is a routing protocol used to identify and exchange routing information **between** autonomous systems.<br>
**Exterior Gateway Protocol** is used to identify and announce network paths.

### EGP Protocols

- **IP** — Internet Protocol specifies the origin and destination for each data packet.
  Routers inspect each packet's IP header to identify where to send them.

- **BGP** — [Border Gateway Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) is a routing protocol used to announce which networks control which IP addresses, and which networks connect to each other.
  (The large networks that make these BGP announcements are called autonomous systems.)
  BGP is a dynamic routing protocol.
