# Routing Protocol

A **Routing Protocol** specifies how routers communicate with each other to distribute information that enables them to select routes between nodes on a computer network.<br>

The specific characteristics of routing protocols include the manner in which they avoid routing loops, the manner in which they select preferred routes, using information about hop costs, the time they require to reach routing convergence, their scalability, and other factors such as relay multiplexing and cloud access framework parameters.

## Types of Routing Protocols

There are two types of routing protocols:

1. **Distance vector** (RIP, IGRP)
2. **Link state** (OSPF, IS-IS)

Cisco has created its own routing protocol â€“ **EIGRP**.<br>
**EIGRP** is considered to be an advanced distance vector protocol, although some materials erroneously state that **EIGRP** is a hybrid routing protocol, a combination of distance vector and link state.
