# Domain Name System (DNS)

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, servces, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other IP networks.
The [[resource records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Resource_records)] contained in the **DNS** associate domain names with other forms of information.
