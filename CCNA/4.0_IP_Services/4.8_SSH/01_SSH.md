# Secure Shell (SSH)

The **Secure Shell (SSH)** protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network devices securely over an unsecured network.

**SSH** applications are based on a client-server architecture, connecting an **SSH Client** instance with an **SSH Server**.
**SSH** operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the transport layer provides server authentication, confidentiality and integrity; the user authentication protocol validates the user to the server; and the connection protoocl multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.

**SSH** uses TCP port 22 by default.
