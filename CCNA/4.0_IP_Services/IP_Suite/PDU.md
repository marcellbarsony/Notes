## Protocol Data Unit

A **Protocol Data Unit** is a single unit of information transmitted among peer entities of a computer network.<br>
A **PDU** is composed of protocol-specific **control information** and **user data**.

## Examples

### OSI model

Protocol data units of the OSI model are:

- **Layer 4:** transport layer PDU is the **segment** or the **datagram**.
- **Layer 3:** network layer PDU is the **packet**.
- **Layer 2:** data link layer PDU is the **frame**.
- **Layer 1:** physical layer PDU is the **bit** or, more generally, **symbol**.

Given a context pertaining to a specific OSI layer, PDU is sometimes used as a synonym for its representation at that layer.

### Internet protocol suite

Protocol data units for the Internet protocol suite are:

- **Layer 4:** transport layer PDU is the **TCP segment** for **TCP**, and the **datagram** for **UDP**.
- **Layer 3:** Internet layer PDU is the **packet**.
- **Layer 2:** link layer PDU is the **frame**.

On TCP/IP over Ethernet, the data on the physical layer is carried in Ethernet frames.
