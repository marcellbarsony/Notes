# DHCP

The **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a client/server network management protocol used on IP networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other configuration information to devices connected to the network.

A **DHCP Client** is a device that is configure to use **DHCP** to request network parameters from a **DHCP Server**.

A **DHCP Server** maintains a pool of available IP addresses and assigns on of them to the host.
A **DHCP Server** server can also provide some other parameters, such as:

- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- Domain name
- DNS Server
