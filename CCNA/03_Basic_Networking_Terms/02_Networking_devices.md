## Attenuation

Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal. The longer the distance the less strong a signal. 

## HUB (Repeater)

A hub is a **Layer 1** device. 

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it.
Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction. 

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it 

The repeater doesn't understand the actual signal but amplifies it from one port to another, 
just like a hub. 

A hub essentially is a multi-port repeater.

## Switch

A switch is a **Layer 2** device.

The switch has "intelligence":  it reads the frames received on Ethernet. 

The switch use a MAC address table to only forward the frames out of the correct ports. 

The switch is used for sending traffic in a LAN. 

## Bridge

A Bridge is an intermediate device between a switch and a hub.

### Bridge vs Switch

* A bridge learns MAC addresses in software.
* The switch learns MAC addresses much more quickly by using hardware **ASIC**s (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)

## Router

A router has routing functionality as it routes from one IP network to another.

## WAN

A Wide Area Network **(WAN)** is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical are for the primary purpose of computer networking.

## Firewall

The Firewall using so called "Firewall rules" to permit or deny traffic.

### Next-generation firewalls

**IDS** - Intrusion Detection System

* An IDS can warn when there's an attack taking place.

**IPS** - Intrusion Prevention System

* An IPS can warn when there's an attach taking place and also block the attack.

## WLC

A Wireless LAN Controller **(WLC)** is used to manages Access Points **(APs)**

## LDC
