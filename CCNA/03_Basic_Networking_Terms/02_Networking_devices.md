Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal. The longer the distance the less strong a signal. 

## HUB (Repeater)

A hub is a Layer 1 device. 

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it.
Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction. 

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it 

The repeater doesn't understand the actual signal but amplifies it from one port to another, 
just like a hub. 

A hub essentially is a multi-port repeater.
