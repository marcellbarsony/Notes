## Network

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair of fibre-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.

### Node

In networking, a node is a specialized device (router, switch, hub, firewall, etc.) or a computing device (laptop, server, phone, etc.).

## MAC address

A Media Access Control **(MAC)** address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller **(NIC)** for use as a network address in communication within a network segment.

MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers and are therefore often referred as the burned-in address or an Ethernet hardware address, and **physical address**. Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the card's read-only memory (ROM), or by a firmware mechanism.

MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator:<br>
```sh
ether 8c:8c:aa:00:6a:2c
```

This use is common in most **IEEE 802** networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

## Modulation

Modulation is a process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation **(FM)** or amplitude modulation **(AM)** for radio broadcast.

## Server

In computing, a server is a computer program or a devices that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

This architecture is called the Server-Client model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.

A server needs to have the capacity (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.) to service the request(s).

A server can provide multiple services for their clients.

## Client

A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

## Protocol

Protocol is a set of rules used for communication between devices. Protocols just like languages.

## Port

Ports are like radio frequencies or TV channels.

| Abbr   | Protocol                           | Port     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| HTTP   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol        | 80       |
| HTTPS  | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure | 443      |
| FTP    | File Transfer Protocol             | 20 & 21  |
