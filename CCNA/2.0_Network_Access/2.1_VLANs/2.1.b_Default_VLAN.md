## Default VLAN

In **Default VLAN (VLAN1)** all switch ports turn into a member of the default VLAN just after the initial boot of the switch.
Because of this, all ports belong to the same broadcast domain, meaning any connected device can communicate with other devices on other ports.

| Criteria               | Default VLAN                                                        | Native VLAN                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default VLAN           | VLAN1 and cannot be changed                                         | VLAN1 and can be changed                                                    |
| Untagged traffic       | Traffic will be sent when both Default and Native VLAN are the same | Traffic can be sent irrespective of Default and Native VLAN being different |
| Operand                | Default VLAN is specified through the VLAN operand command          | Native VLAN is specified through the NATIVE operand command                 |
| Disabling              | It is not possible to disable Default VLAN                          | It is possible to disable Native VLAN                                       |
| Encapsulation          | Supports .1Q and ISL                                                | Supports .1Q only                                                           |
| Tagging                | Tagging is allowed                                                  | Tagging is allowed if required but untagged by default                      |
| DTP traffic            | DTP is not sent to Default VLAN                                     | While it is sent on Native VLAN                                             |
| Maximum number of VLAN | One default VLAN per switch                                         | Native VLAN can be as many as there are .1Q trunks on the switch            |
