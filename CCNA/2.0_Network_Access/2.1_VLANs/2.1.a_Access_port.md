# Access ports

Essentially, **access ports** handle traffic for one VLAN, while **trunk ports** are equipped to route traffic to and from multiple VLANs using a tagging protocol.

An **access port** can be assigned to a single VLAN.<br>
This type of interface is configured on switch ports that are connected to end devices such as workstation, printers, or access points.
