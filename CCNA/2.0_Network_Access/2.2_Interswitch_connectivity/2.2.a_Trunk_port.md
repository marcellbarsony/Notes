# Trunking

In telecommunications, **trunking** is a technology for providing network access to multiple clients simultaneously by sharing a set of circuits, carriers, channels, or frequencies, instead of providing individual circuits or channels for each client.

In the context of Ethernet VLANs, Cisco uses the therm **Ethernet trunking** to mean carrying multiple VLANs through a single network link through the use of a **trunking protocol**.
To allow for multiple VLANs on one link, frames from individual VLANs must be identified.
The most common and preferred method, **IEEE 802.1Q** adds a tag to the Ethernet frame, labeling it as belonging to a certain VLAN.
Cisco also has a (now deprecated) proprietary trunking protocol, **Inter-Switch Link**, which encapsulates the Ethernet frame with its own container, which labels the frame as belonging to a specific VLAN.

## Trunk port

A **trunk port** that is connected to another switch.<br>
A **trunk port** can transmit data from multiple VLANs - If a switch has multiple VLANs, no additional switches or cabling is needed for each VLAN, just one single link.
In contrast to an **access port**, a **trunk port** must use tagging in order to allow signals to get to the correct endpoint.
**Trunk ports** typically offer higher bandwidth and lower latency than access ports.<br>
**Trunk ports** enabling you to extend VLANs across the entire network.<br>
