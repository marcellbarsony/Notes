# IEEE 802.1Q

**IEEE 802.1Q** (referred as **Dot1q**) is the networking standard that supports VLANs on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network.<br>
This standard was created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), so it is an open standard and also can be used on non-Cisco switches.

### Frame format

To identify which VLAN a frame belongs to, a 802.1Q adds a 32-bit field between the source MAC address and the [Ether type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherType) fields of the original frame.

| Destination MAC | Source MAC | **802.1Q Tag** | Length/Type | Data | FCS |

Under 802.1Q, the **maximum frame size** is extended from 1518 bytes to 1522 bytes.<br>
The **minimum frame size** remains 64 bytes, but a bridge may extend the minimum size frame from 64 to 68 bytes on transmission.

### Tag protocol identifier (TPID)

A 16-bit field set to a value of **0x8100** in order to identify the frame as an IEEE 802.1Q-tagged frame.<br>
This field is located at the same position as the EtherType field in untagged frames, and is thus used to distinguish the frame from untagged frames.

### Tag control information (TCI)

A 16-bit field containing the following sub-fields:

#### Priority code point (PCP)

A 3-bit field which refers to the IEEE 802.1p class of service and maps to the frame priority level.<br>
Different PCP values can be used to prioritize different classes of traffic.

#### Drop eligible indicator (DEI)

A 1-bit field.<br>
(formerly CFI) May be used separately or in conjunction with PCP to indicate frames eligible to be dropped in the presence of congestion.

#### VLAN identifier (VLAN ID - VID)

A 12-bit field specifying the VLAN to which the frame belongs.<br>
The values of 0 and 4095 (0x000 and 0xFFF in hexadecimal) are reserved.
All other values may be used as VLAN identifiers, allowing up to 4,094 VLANs.

The reserved value 0x000 indicates that the frame does not carry a VLAN ID; in this case, the 802.1Q tag specifies only a priority (in PCP and DEI fields) and is referred to as a priority tag.
On bridges, VID 0x001 (the default VLAN ID) is often reserved for a network management VLAN; this is vendor-specific.
The VID value 0xFFF is reserved for implementation use; it must not be configured or transmitted.
0xFFF can be used to indicate a wildcard match in management operations or filtering database entries.
