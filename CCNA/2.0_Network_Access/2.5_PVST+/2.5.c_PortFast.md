# Cisco PortFast

**PortFast** causes a switch or trunk port to enter the spanning tree forwarding state immediately, bypassing the listening and learning states.<br>

**PortFast** can be used on switch or trunk ports that are connected to a single workstation, switch, or server to allow those devices to connect to the network immediately, instead of waiting for the port to transition from the listening and learning states to forward state.

When the switch powers up, or when a device is connected to a port, the port enters the spanning tree listening state. When the Forward Delay timer expires, the port enters the learning state. When the Forward Delay timer expires a second time, the port is transitioned to the forwarding or blocking state.

When you enable PortFast on a switch or trunk port, the port is immediately transitioned to the spanning tree forwarding state.

## Configuring PortFast

### Configuring PortFast on Access Port

To enable PortFast on a switch port, perform this task in interface mode:

```
S1(config)# interface range g1/0/1 - 3
S1(config-if-range)#spanning-tree portfast
%Warning: portfast should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this
interface  when portfast is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
Use with CAUTION

%Portfast has been configured on GigabitEthernet1/0/1 but will only
have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.

%Portfast has been configured on GigabitEthernet1/0/2 but will only
have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.

%Portfast has been configured on GigabitEthernet1/0/3 but will only
have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.
```

Verify PortFast settings

```
S1#show run

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 spanning-tree portfast
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/2
 spanning-tree portfast
!
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3
 spanning-tree portfast
```

Disable PortFast

```
S1(config-if-range)#spanning-tree portfast disable
```
