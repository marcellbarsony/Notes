# SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

**Server-Side Request Forgery** cause the server-side application to make
requests to an unintended location

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a
connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure.
In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary
external systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as authorization
credentials.
