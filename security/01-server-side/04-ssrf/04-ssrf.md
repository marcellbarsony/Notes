## Description

**Server-Side Request Forgery** cause the server-side application to make requests
to an unintended location

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server
to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's
infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect
to arbitrary external systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as
authorization credentials.
