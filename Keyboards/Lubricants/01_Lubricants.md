## Linear Switches: Lube Them!

Linear switches benefit the most from lubrication.
Since linear switches are already designed to be smooth and consistent, adding lubricant just takes them to the next level.
If you have linear switches and want to start lubricating them, do it! The switches will only improve.

- Krytox 205g0 – For a smoother and buttery feel. Less is more.
- Krytox 206g
- Tribosys 3203 – A thin lubricant that creates a fast and smooth feel.
- Trbisosy 3204 – Thicker than 3203 but is hard to mess up.
- Krytox 105 Oil – Recommended for the springs only to prevent spring ping.

For a linear switch, you want a thicker viscosity, our favorite lubricant for a linear switch is the Krytox 205G switch lubricant on Kebo Store. The lube is the perfect mix for a linear switch and comes with a brush and enough lube for your keyboard. Another option is the Krytox 206G switch lubricant.

## Tactile Switches: Lube Them!

Tactile switches have a small tactile bump with each keystroke, so will lubing the switch ruin the tactility?
Nope, feel free to lube them.
Lubing your tactile switches will get rid of the scratchiness at the tactile bump, so it will improve the sound and feel of the switch.

- Tribosys 3203 – Retains tactility while smoothening up the keypress.
- Krytox 205g0 – Muted sound and less tactility but buttery smooth.
- Krytox GPL 105
- Trbisosy 3204 – Thicker than 3203, a middle ground of tactility and smoothness.
- Krytox 105 Oil – Recommended for the springs only to prevent spring ping.

For a tactile switch your going to want a lubricant that is a lower viscosity. Our favorite lubricant for a tactile switch is the Krytox GPL 105 Switch Lubricant. It comes with a brush and enough lube for your keyboard. It’s the perfect mix for a tactile switch.

Another option is the Krytox 205g if you don’t mind the tactile bump getting slightly smaller.
