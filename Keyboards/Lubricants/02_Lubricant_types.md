# Lubricant Types

Let’s get down to business and talk about picking out lubricants.
Which one to use?
Which one to avoid?
There are several different factors to consider such as if the lubricant is an oil or grease, and the overall viscosity of the lubricant.

## Oil vs Grease Lubricants

There are two main types of lubricants: oil and grease. So what’s the difference? The primary difference between the two comes down to the application. Neither are better when it comes to performance, but you can make the lubing process a bit quicker if you choose oil/grease smartly.

### Oil Lubricants

With oil, you have the option of mass-lubing springs all in a bag while brushing the housing and stem. So, it saves you a little bit of time. Lubing switches is already a time-consuming process, but we want to do what we can to make it quicker.

### Grease Lubricants

Grease can only be brushed on each individual part: housing, stem, and spring. This requires a bit more time to do, instead of throwing all of the springs in a bag and oiling them all at once. Most people use a mix of oil and grease, they mass-lube the springs with oil and then brush on grease to the rest of the switch.

## Viscosity of the Lubricant

Viscosity is extremely important for picking out lubricant for you switches and stabilizers. A higher viscosity means the more dense and thicker the lubricant will be. For example, honey has a higher viscosity than juice.

The general rule of thumb for viscosity is: Lower viscosity lubricants are better for tactile and clicky switches. Higher viscosity lubricants are better for linear switches. Stabilizers need a thick and viscous grease, not a thin one.

For tactile and clicky switches, good viscosities are at 3203 or 203. For linear switches, a 205 of 206 may be better. The 3204, 204, and 104 can be used for either linear or tactile switches. The numbers refer to the viscosity of the individual product, which we’ll get more into later.
