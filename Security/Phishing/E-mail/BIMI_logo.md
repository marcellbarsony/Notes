# BIMI Logo - Brand Indicators for Message Identification Logo

Brand Indicators for Message Identification or BIMI (pronounced: Bih-mee) is an emerging email specification that enables the use of brand-controlled logos within supporting email clients.
BIMI leverages the work an organization has put into deploying DMARC protection, by bringing brand logos to the customer’s inbox.
For the brand’s logo to be displayed, the email must pass DMARC authentication checks, ensuring that the organization’s domain has not been impersonated.
