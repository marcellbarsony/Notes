## Vulnerability Management - Lifecycle

1. Discover

Recognize the significance of asset discovery (both On-Premise and Cloud-based).
Identify host assets throughout the entire enterprise architecture.

2. Organize Assets

Organize discovered assets with Qualys **Asset Inventory** and **Asset View**.

3. Assess

The primary objective of the Asses Phase is finding vulnerabilities on the host assets.
The data needed to perform a vulnerability assessment can come from the combination of sensors, scanner appliances or agents.

4. Report

All findings are stored in the Qualys Cloud Platform, where reporting tools and features allow you to identify the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to the organization and share these findings with the operational team.

5. Remediate

Remediation tools and features can help to prioritize the detected vulnerabilities and identify the vulnerabilities that have been successfully mitigated.

6. Verify

Verify vulnerabilities that have been patched or fixed.
This task is performed automatically every time a scanner appliance (agent or sensor) provides new assessment data to the Qualys Cloud Platform.

The assessment test - that was originally used to detect the vulnerability - will be used again to verify the successful application of the patch or the fix.
