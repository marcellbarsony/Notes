## Identify Unsupported Software and Hardware

**CSAM** allows you to visualize product lifecycle information to easily identify unsupported assets that no longer receive security updates, plan hardware refresh and software upgrades using information about upcoming lifecycle events.

### Product Lifecycle widget

On the **CSAM Home Page**, the **Product Lifecycle** widget gives a snapshot of all the software and hardware lifecycle information.

#### Software

- **EOL** — End-of-Life implies that the software will no longer receive feature updates.

- **EOS** — End-of-Support refers to the date when it's no longer serviced via upgrades, patches, or maintenance.

#### Hardware

- **EOS** — End-of-Sale implies that the hardware is no longer being sold by the vendor.

- **OBS** — Obsolete implies that the hardware is no longer serviced via upgrades, patches, or maintenance.
