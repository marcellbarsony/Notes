# Get Business Context through CMDB Sync

By integrating with ServiceNow CMDB, Qualys asset inventory can be enriched by importing relevant business context, such as asset owner, environment, business applications and other key data into CSAM to improve response to asset health issues.

CMDB Sync must be configured for the Qualys account - which is done by using the ServiceNow-certified CMDB Sync App.
