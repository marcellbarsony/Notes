## Highlight

Some Markdown processors allows text highlighting. To highlight words, use two equal signs (==) before and after the words.

```
These ==important words== must be highlighted.
```

Output:

These ==important words== must be highlighted.

Alternatively, HTML tags (\<mark>) can be used if the Markdown application supports them.

```
These <mark>important words</mark> must be highlighted.
```

These <mark>important words</mark> must be highlighted.
