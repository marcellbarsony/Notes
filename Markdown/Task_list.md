## Task list

Task lists (also referred to as _checklist_ or _todo lists_) can be created in Markdown applications that support task lists with the following syntax:

```
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media
```

Output:

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media
